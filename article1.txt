Climate scientists around the world have issued a new warning about the rising rate of global warming. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), temperatures are increasing faster than previously predicted, especially in densely populated regions across Asia and Africa. The report highlights that heatwaves, floods, forest fires, and irregular monsoon patterns will become more frequent in the next ten years if corrective measures are not taken.

The report states that countries must reduce emissions by at least 45% by 2030 to prevent catastrophic climate effects. Many nations have pledged carbon neutrality but lack clear action plans or financial resources. Developing countries argue that wealthy nations should contribute more because they have historically produced the highest carbon emissions.

Extreme weather patterns have already disrupted millions of lives. In 2023 alone, more than 40 million people were displaced due to climate-related events. Economists warn that climate change could reduce global GDP by nearly 10% by 2050 if no intervention is made. The report encourages immediate adoption of renewable energy sources, green technology investments, and stricter government regulations.
