The research article explores the growing impact of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, noting its ability to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce medical mistakes, and enhance patient care. AI models trained on large datasets can detect early signs of diseases such as cancer or cardiac issues, sometimes outperforming human experts. These technologies also help hospitals speed up diagnosis, improve patient triage, and reduce administrative burden on medical staff.

However, the article also highlights significant concerns. Data privacy issues, algorithmic bias, and lack of patient consent remain ongoing challenges. There is fear that poorly regulated AI systems could worsen existing healthcare inequalities or lead to overdependence on automation. To ensure safe implementation, researchers stress the importance of combining AI's computational strength with human supervision and ethical safeguards. The article concludes that while AI has immense potential, responsible use is essential for truly improving healthcare systems.
