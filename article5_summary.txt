This policy report highlights the growing disparity between rural and urban education systems, noting that fewer than 60% of rural students have reliable access to digital learning tools. Poor infrastructure and insufficient teacher training worsen this divide.

To address the issue, researchers recommend government investment in e-learning platforms, affordable internet access, and large-scale teacher training in digital technologies. The report also promotes establishing community learning centers in remote areas to share resources and enhance access.

If adopted, these measures could reduce dropout rates and improve learning outcomes. The report concludes that digital literacy must be treated as a national priority to prepare students for future careers.
